This is utility script that parses the DeviantArt main page and extracts a list of all the pictures on it.

Then it cycles through all of them.

Hence you can use it as a "digital signage".

Motivation
==========

The company I work in sometimes offers a two display setup for developers.

Not everyone can have it - the company doesn't have enough money to buy good hardware for everyone.

Usually you can grab one when someone is being upgraded (or fired).

I don't like using two displays because I like to have the image straight in front of me.

So I didn't really mind if I had the second display.

Today I had a chance to grab the second display for myself (before anyone else noticed it) but I didn't find any suitable use case for it.

Anyway a chance to get extra equipment is rather rare so I didn't hesitate.

Finally I got an idea: I could use the display as a comforting device.

There is an extremely good community on a website called DeviantArt (I used to have an account there myself when I was a student).

I googled for "live photo stream" for about an hour and literally didn't find anything.

So I decided to stick to the proverb: "If you want something to be done properly - you better do it yourself".

Running
=======

Run the application by executing the "run.sh" script.

Then in your web browser go to http://localhost:9000 and enter fullscreen mode (F11 for Chrome).

You can click on an image to skip it.

The image list is updated every cycle.

You might want to check the browser console for errors and debugging info.

The script isn't tested well for now, so errors of all kinds might to happen.
